# Kam's Portfolio

The goal of this website is to exhibit my abilities, projects, and present a platform for potential employers to learn more about me.

## Technologies Used

The portfolio website is built using the following technologies:

- HTML5: Used for the structure and content of the web pages.
- CSS3: Used for styling and layout of the website.
- JavaScript: Used to add interactivity and dynamic features.
- jQuery: A JavaScript library used for DOM manipulation and event handling.

    - JS and jQuery were used to change the background of the body with the "change background" button. 
        The hover function changes the color of the project divs when the mouse hovers over them.
        The text is also displayed when we click on one of the project divs.

## Approach

The approach taken for building this portfolio website involved the following steps:

1. **Planning and Design**: I started by planning the structure and layout of the website. I identified the sections I wanted to include, such as the header, introduction, skills, projects, resume, and contact me section. I also designed a simple and clean visual style for the website.

2. **HTML Markup**: I created the HTML markup for each section of the website. I structured the content using semantic HTML elements and added relevant classes and IDs for styling and JavaScript manipulation.

3. **CSS Styles**: Applied CSS styles to the HTML elements to achieve the desired look. I used CSS properties such as background color, margins, spacing, font style, position, etc. to create an aesthetically pleasing layout. 

4. **JavaScript and jQuery**: I utilized JavaScript and jQuery to include interactivity to the site. I executed highlights like smooth looking over route, picture slideshow, drift impacts on extended portrayals, and a button to alter the foundation image dynamically.

5. **Testing and Refinement**: All through the improvement preparation, I tried the site on distinctive browsers to check for compatibility and responsiveness.
