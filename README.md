# Kam's Portfolio

The purpose of this website is to showcase my skills, projects, and provide a platform for potential employers or clients to learn more about me.

## Technologies Used

The portfolio website is built using the following technologies:

- HTML5: Used for the structure and content of the web pages.
- CSS3: Used for styling and layout of the website.
- JavaScript: Used to add interactivity and dynamic features.
- jQuery: A JavaScript library used for DOM manipulation and event handling.

    - JS and jQuery were used to change the background of the body with the "change background" button. 
        The hover function changes the color of the project divs when the mouse hovers over them.
        The text is also displayed when we click on one of the project divs.

## Approach

The approach taken for building this portfolio website involved the following steps:

1. **Planning and Design**: I started by planning the structure and layout of the website. I identified the sections I wanted to include, such as the header, introduction, skills, projects, resume, and contact me section. I also designed a simple and clean visual style for the website.

2. **HTML Markup**: I created the HTML markup for each section of the website. I structured the content using semantic HTML elements and added relevant classes and IDs for styling and JavaScript manipulation.

3. **CSS Styling**: I applied CSS styles to the HTML elements to achieve the desired visual appearance. I used CSS properties like background colors, margins, padding, font styles, and positioning to create an aesthetically pleasing layout.

4. **JavaScript and jQuery**: I used JavaScript and jQuery to add interactivity to the website. I implemented features like smooth scrolling navigation, image slideshow, hover effects on project descriptions, and a button to change the background image dynamically.

5. **Testing and Refinement**: Throughout the development process, I tested the website on different devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. He made adjustments to the design and functionality based on user feedback and his own testing.
